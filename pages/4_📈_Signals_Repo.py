        Jonpaul helped develop an API for a client-facing signals repository that allowed for enhanced model development.  As the Python specialist for the project, he developed specialized geo-based features which allowed users to see engineered signals over time for user-defined regions.  

        The <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/services/signals-repository.html">Signals Repository</a> is used by large clients looking for additive data signals to generate new insights into targeted areas for their businesses.
